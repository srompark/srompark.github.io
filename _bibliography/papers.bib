  abstract={Sketching algorithms or sketches enable accurate network measurement results with low resource footprints. While emerging programmable switches are an attractive target to get these benefits, current implementations of sketches are either inefficient and/or infeasible on hardware. Our contributions in the paper are: (1) systematically analyzing the resource bottlenecks of existing sketch implementations in hardware; (2) identifying practical and correct-by-construction optimization techniques to tackle the identified bottlenecks; and (3) designing an easy-to-use library called SketchLib to help developers efficiently implement their sketch algorithms in switch hardware to benefit from these resource optimizations. Our evaluation on state-of-the-art sketches demonstrates that SketchLib reduces the hardware resource footprint up to 96% without impacting fidelity.},

  abstract={Sketching algorithms or sketches are attractive as telemetry capabilities on programmable hardware switches since they offer rigorous accuracy guarantees and use compact data structures. However, we find that in practice, their actual implementations can have a significant (up to 94\times×) accuracy drop compared to theoretical expectations. We find that the delays incurred by pulling and resetting the data plane state induce accuracy degradation. We design and implement solutions to reduce the delays and show that our solutions can help eliminate almost all the inaccuracy of existing sketch workflows.},

  abstract={The emergence of programmable switches offers a new opportunity to revisit ISP-scale defenses for volumetric DDoS attacks. In theory, these can offer better cost vs. performance vs. flexibility trade-offs relative to proprietary hardware and virtual appliances. However, the ISP setting creates unique challenges in this regard—we need to run a broad spectrum of detection and mitigation functions natively on the programmable switch hardware and respond to dynamic adaptive attacks at scale. Thus, prior efforts in using programmable switches that assume out-of-band detection and/or use switches merely as accelerators for specific tasks are no longer sufficient, and as such, this potential remains unrealized. To tackle these challenges, we design and implement Jaqen, a switch-native approach for volumetric DDoS defense that can run detection and mitigation functions entirely inline on switches, without relying on additional data plane hardware. We design switch-optimized, resource-efficient detection and mitigation building blocks. We design a flexible API to construct a wide spectrum of best-practice (and future) defense strategies that efficiently use switch capabilities. We build a network-wide resource manager that quickly adapts to the attack posture changes. Our experiments show that Jaqen is orders of magnitude more performant than existing systems: Jaqen can handle large-scale hybrid and dynamic attacks within seconds, and mitigate them effectively at high line-rates (380 Gbps).},

  author={Liu, Zaoxing and Namkung, Hun and Agarwal, Anup and Manousis, Antonis and Steenkiste, Peter and Seshan, Srinivasan and Sekar, Vyas},
  abstract={Sketching algorithms or sketches have emerged as a promising alternative to the traditional packet samplingbased network telemetry solutions. At a high level, they are attractive because of their high resource efficiency and provable accuracy guarantees. While there have been significant recent advances in various aspects of sketching for networking tasks, many fundamental challenges remain unsolved that are likely stumbling blocks for adoption. Our contribution in this paper is in identifying and formulating these research challenges across the ecosystem encompassing network operators, platform vendors/developers, and algorithm designers. We hope that these serve as a necessary fillip for the community to enable the broader adoption of sketch-based telemetry.},

  abstract={Understanding app-specific behavior is important for network operation and management. However, it is often difficult because it requires an in-depth application-layer protocol analysis due to the common use of HTTP(S) and standard data representations (e.g., JSON). This paper presents Extractocol, the first system to offer an automatic and comprehensive analysis of application protocol behaviors for Android applications. Extractocol only uses Android application binary as input and accurately reconstructs HTTP transactions (request-response pairs) and identifies their message formats and relationships using binary analysis. Our evaluation and in-depth case studies on closed-source and open-source apps demonstrate that Extractocol accurately reconstructs network message formats and characterizes network-related application behaviors.},
