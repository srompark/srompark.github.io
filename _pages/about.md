I am an Assistant Professor in the Industrial Engineering Department ([IE](https://ie.unist.ac.kr/)) at Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST) with joint appointment in the Artificial Intelligence Graduate School ([AIGS](https://aigs.unist.ac.kr/web/index.php)). I received a B.S. and Ph.D. in industrial engineering from Seoul National University in 2013 and 2018. My research focuses on safe machine learning, which includes: security-enhanced machine learning, privacy-preserving machine learning and fairness-aware machine learning. I lead the [Safe AI Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/safe-ai-lab). I am married to [Hun Namkung](https://hnamkung.github.io/).

I am actively looking for prospective undergraduate/master/Ph.D. students or postdocs. If you are interested in working with me, please feel free to [send me](mailto:srompark@unist.ac.kr) an email with the information about your research interests and relevant background experiences.
